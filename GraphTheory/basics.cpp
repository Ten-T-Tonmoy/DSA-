/**
 * Graphs
 * basically vertices and Edges(that connects)
 * G=(V,E)
 * Directed graph=>if edges have direction
 * self-loop =>if a vertices has directed to itself
 * parallel edges=>if 2 nodes has edge loop
 * **Indegree =>Edges going in
 * **Outdegree =>Edges going out
 * graph=> undreicted graph
 * digraph=>directed graph
 * **Degree=>in undir num of edges connected to other edge
 * 
 * Types--------------------------
 * 
 * simple graph=> without self and parrlell loop
 * two grphs non connected gets connected on connected componenets(that connects)
 * articulation points=>connection point removing which will disconnect
 * if biconnected means one removed it wont be disconnected
 * 
 * **path=> set of all vertices between 2 vertices
 * 
 * **from any point any point can be reached =>strongly connected
 * **DAG=> directed acyclic graph (in arranging in linear it will be forward directing)
