# ðŸ“˜ ICE2232 â€“ Data Structure and Algorithm Lab (2024)

### **Lab Assignment 1: Exploring Array Data Structures and Algorithms**

**Objective:**
To provide students with a comprehensive understanding of arrays, their operations, and algorithms that involve arrays.

---

## **Task 1: Basic Array Operations**

1. Create a program in your preferred programming language (Python, C++, Java) to:

   - (i) Declare an integer array with a size of at least 10.
   - (ii) Initialize the array with random values (using a random number generator).
   - (iii) Print the elements of the array.

2. Extend your program with functions to:

   - (i) Calculate and print the sum of all elements.
   - (ii) Find and print the maximum and minimum values.
   - (iii) Calculate and print the average value of the elements.

## **Task 2: Array Sorting Algorithms**

1. Implement the following sorting algorithms for an integer array:

   - (i) Selection Sort
   - (ii) Bubble Sort
   - (iii) Insertion Sort

2. Create a program that:

   - Allows the user to choose one of the sorting algorithms.
   - Accepts an array as input.
   - Sorts and prints the array using the selected algorithm.

---

## **Task 3: Searching in Sorted Arrays**

1. Implement the **Binary Search** algorithm for an integer array.
2. Create a program that:

   - (a) Declares an array of integers and sorts it using one of the sorting algorithms from **Task 2**.
   - (b) Allows the user to enter a value to search.
   - (c) Uses Binary Search to find and print whether the value is found or not.

---

## **Task 4: Merge Two Sorted Arrays**

1. Write a program to merge two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted array.
2. Implement the merging algorithm efficiently with **O(n)** time complexity (where _n_ is the total number of elements in both arrays).
3. Print the merged sorted array.

---

### **Lab Assignment 2: Searching, Sorting, and Merging Multi-dimensional Arrays**

**Objective:**
To help students understand multi-dimensional arrays, practice searching, sorting, and merging algorithms, and apply these skills to real-world scenarios.

---

## **Task 5: Searching in a 2D Array**

1. Create a program that:

   - (a) Declares a 2D integer array of a chosen size.
   - (b) Populates the array with random values.
   - (c) Accepts a value to search.
   - (d) Implements a search algorithm (linear/binary search) to find the value in the 2D array.
   - (e) Prints the position (row & column) if found, otherwise prints a "not found" message.

---

## **Task 6: Sorting Rows in a 2D Array**

1. Extend the program to:

   - Sort the **rows** of the 2D array in ascending order based on a chosen column (user-specified).
   - Use an efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., QuickSort or MergeSort).
   - Print the sorted 2D array.

---

## **Task 7: Merge Two 2D Arrays**

1. Create a program to merge two 2D integer arrays into a single 2D array.
2. Implement the merging algorithm efficiently with **O(n)** time complexity (where _n_ is the total number of elements).
3. Print the merged 2D array.
