**Course:** ICE 2232: Data Structures and Algorithms Lab
**Topic:** Stack, Queue, and Recursion

## **Experiment 01: Handling Stack and Queue**

**Objective:** Create a program that implements both a stack and a queue, and processes commands.

**Commands:**

- **s** – Set mode to **STACK MODE** and print the current contents of the stack on one line (top at left). Do not show the sentinel.
- **q** – Set mode to **QUEUE MODE** and print the current contents of the queue on one line (head at left). Do not show the sentinel.
- **Integer input** – Push onto the stack (STACK MODE) or insert at the tail of the queue (QUEUE MODE), then print it.
- **p** – Pop the top of the stack (STACK MODE) or remove the item at the head of the queue (QUEUE MODE), then print it.
- **Q** – Exit the program and free all memory.

## **Experiment 02: Quick Sort**

**Objective:** Write a program that stores `n` numbers in an array and sorts them using the **Quick Sort algorithm**.

**Application:** Stack

## **Experiment 03: Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions**

**Objective:** Write a program to evaluate a given arithmetic expression in **infix, postfix, or prefix notation**.

**Application:** Stack

---

## **Experiment 04: Transforming Arithmetic Expressions**

**Objective:** Write a program to transform arithmetic expressions:

1. **Prefix ↔ Infix**
2. **Postfix ↔ Infix**
3. **Prefix ↔ Postfix**

**Application:** Stack

## **Experiment 05: Tower of Hanoi**

**Objective:** Solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.

- Invented by **Edouard Lucas** in 1883.
- Given **8 disks** initially stacked in decreasing size on one of three pegs.
- Transfer the entire tower to another peg (the third peg), moving **only one disk at a time** and **never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk**.

**Application:** Recursion
