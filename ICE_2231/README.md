## How to Navigate

1. Each topic has its **own folder** (e.g., `Array Week`, `Linked List`).
2. Inside each folder, the **README.md file** contains the problem statement or question.
3. Navigate to the corresponding `**solution files/Task/Question**` in the folder to see implementations.
4. Solutions are organized per task for easy reference and testing.

## Notes

- Code files use **C++ with `bits/stdc++.h`** for simplicity.
- Execution instructions and input/output examples are usually provided in each solution file.
