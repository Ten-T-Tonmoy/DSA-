# DSA Applied Codes 🚀

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with practical code examples and problem-solving approaches. I'm starting from the basics and gradually working my way up to more advanced topics.

## 🔰 Introduction

I created this repository to:

- Keep track of my progress in DSA.
- Implement algorithms and solve problems to solidify my understanding.
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.

Currently, I’ve completed linked lists and will keep updating this repository as I work through new topics.
